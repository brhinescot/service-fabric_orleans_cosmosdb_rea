                "iss" (Issuer) Claim
            </summary>
            <remarks>
                The "iss" (issuer) claim identifies the principal that issued the
                JWT.  The processing of this claim is generally application specific.
                The "iss" value is a case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI
                value.  Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.

                "sub" (Subject) Claim
            </summary>
            <remarks>
                The "sub" (subject) claim identifies the principal that is the
                subject of the JWT.  The claims in a JWT are normally statements
                about the subject.  The subject value MUST either be scoped to be
                locally unique in the context of the issuer or be globally unique.
                The processing of this claim is generally application specific.  The
                "sub" value is a case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI
                value.  Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.

                "aud" (Audience) Claim
            </summary>
            <remarks>
                The "aud" (audience) claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is
                intended for.  Each principal intended to process the JWT MUST
                identify itself with a value in the audience claim.  If the principal
                processing the claim does not identify itself with a value in the
                "aud" claim when this claim is present, then the JWT MUST be
                rejected.  In the general case, the "aud" value is an array of case-
                sensitive strings, each containing a StringOrURI value.  In the
                special case when the JWT has one audience, the "aud" value MAY be a
                single case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI value.  The
                interpretation of audience values is generally application specific.
                Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.

                "nbf" (Not Before) Claim (default is UTC NOW)
            </summary>
            <remarks>
                The "nbf" (not before) claim identifies the time before which the JWT
                MUST NOT be accepted for processing.  The processing of the "nbf"
                claim requires that the current date/time MUST be after or equal to
                the not-before date/time listed in the "nbf" claim.  Implementers MAY
                provide for some small leeway, usually no more than a few minutes, to
                account for clock skew.  Its value MUST be a number containing a
                NumericDate value.  Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.

                "iat" (Issued At) Claim (default is UTC NOW)
            </summary>
            <remarks>
                The "iat" (issued at) claim identifies the time at which the JWT was
                issued.  This claim can be used to determine the age of the JWT.  Its
                value MUST be a number containing a NumericDate value.  Use of this
                claim is OPTIONAL.

                "exp" (Expiration Time) Claim (returns IssuedAt + ValidFor)
            </summary>
            <remarks>
                The "exp" (expiration time) claim identifies the expiration time on
                or after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing.  The
                processing of the "exp" claim requires that the current date/time
                MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the "exp" claim.
                Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no more than
                a few minutes, to account for clock skew.  Its value MUST be a number
                containing a NumericDate value.  Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.

                "jti" (JWT ID) Claim (default ID is a GUID)
            </summary>
            <remarks>
                The "jti" (JWT ID) claim provides a unique identifier for the JWT.
                The identifier value MUST be assigned in a manner that ensures that
                there is a negligible probability that the same value will be
                accidentally assigned to a different data object; if the application
                uses multiple issuers, collisions MUST be prevented among values
                produced by different issuers as well.  The "jti" claim can be used
                to prevent the JWT from being replayed.  The "jti" value is a case-
                sensitive string.  Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.
